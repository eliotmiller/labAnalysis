\title{Batch read multiple csv files to list}
\usage{
  readIn(path, row.names = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{The path of the directory containing the
  files to be read}

  \item{row.names}{Do the files to be read in have row
  names? Default is yes. If not, set this argument to
  FALSE.}
}
\value{
  A list with each file stored as a separate element.
}
\description{
  Read in all the files from a given directory and save
  each to a different element of a list.
}
\details{
  This function reads in all the files from a given
  directory and stores each as a separate element in a
  list. The names of the original files do not matter, but
  the function assumes all to be comma-delimited files with
  the row names stored in the first column and with each
  column having a name. Can modify this in the future if
  others find it useful.
